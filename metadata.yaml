description: Covering almost 30 years in the life and loves of Mark Lennan, The Dark
  Flower opens in 1880 with 18-year-old undergraduate Mark studying art at Oxford,
  and ends 30 years later with Mark ostensibly happily married, yet torn between his
  wife and a beautiful teenage girl--the last and most disturbing manifestation of
  the "dark flower" of passion. Within a dozen pages, Galsworthy establishes his mastery
  of compelling narrative and sketches an irresistible plot. Much of his achievement
  lies in the mixture of pathos and humor that he derives from characters little able
  to express their feelings. There is much else to admire, from Galsworthy's impressionistic
  descriptions and eye for detail to the subtle symmetry he creates between his characters,
  emphasizing the cyclical nature of the story. Published in 1913, the story also
  holds the fascination of a world about to be transformed by war--one in which a
  love letter could still be delivered by the hand of a discreet manservant, and the
  residents of Piccadilly kept their horses stabled close by so that they could gallop
  down to Richmond for fresh air.
